      title: Distributed Leadership
      colour: "#EF233C"
    text:
      - T. E. Shaw co-founded AuxCode in 2013, while based in Germany. One of the co-founders was in Canada and one in Bulgaria.
      - AuxCode has not had defined C-level roles for the first seven years. The three co-founders took the decisions in a unnanimous, distributed manner.
      - When T. E. saw the book, he shouted "We have been doing this for years!" And the connection with Caterina Maniscalco worked from the first moment.

      text: "Empower your senior team members: you can’t do it all, and you owe it to yourself as well as the team members that work for you to give them a chance to spread their wings and take on additional responsibility that — should their own careers progress — they will need to take on eventually themselves."
