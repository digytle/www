      - The same applies to the Executives. They are expected to be strong, to know everything, to manage, survive and succeed.
      - And they need help.
      - T. E. Shaw has spent decades discovering and developing executive talent, helping individuals to cross the threshold, to make sense of the world they have arrived into, to be content and to be successful.
