      - A common cliche says, that the difference between boys and men is the price of the toys. Sexism aside, this chliche is built one a major misconception and the misconception is, that there are no "toys".
      - What we, the adults, see as childhood and play, the children see as dead serious. The babies do not spend their time being sweet, cute and cuddly, but adapting to a world they have never seen and learning with all their beimg.
      - The same applies to the Executives. They are expected to be strong, to know everything, to manage, survive and succeed.
      - And they need help.
      - T. E. Shaw has spent decades discovering and developing executive talent, helping individuals to cross the threshold, to make sense of the world they have arrived into, to be content and to be successful.

        - This group needs most help.
        - The 1-[1-1-1)-1 model is a potent key to realisation, while providing the needed stability.

      title: The Jib of Pareto
      description: The 20/80 principle of Pareto is good, but frequently too complex, especially for people with little experience or under stress. The jib methhor is much stronger and more helpful. The jib is the front sail of a ship, which is attached at three points. When these points are the right ones, the sail is full of wind and the ship sails.
